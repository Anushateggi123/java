//java test

1. 10,34
2. Zudio
3. 50
4. sum is 200 length is 4
6. Parameters are the datatypes which specified inside the method braces.you can pass values/arguments to the method parameter, at the method call
7. compile time polymorphism is achieved through static binding. 
example for compile time polymorphism is method overloading.
In which method overloading is having same name but different in parameters.
There are 3 ways in method overloading:
changing number of parameters
changing types of parameters
changing order of parameters
8. varible arguments  is a method which takes the variable number of values.varargs must be the last argument.
Syntax of varargs is (arg)
9. Packages is a group of similar kind of classes , subpackages and interfaces.
There are two types in packages:
Built-in packages
User-defined packages
package keyword is used to create package in java.
Types of imports: 
Implicit import : when we load all classes of package using * it will call as implicit package.
Explicit import : classes are present inside the package, when we give proper path it will call as explicit import.
10. Construtor Chaining : Calling constructor from one contructor to other constructor.
we can achieve constructor by using this() and super().
Where this() is which calls constructor from same class and super() which calls constructor from parent class.
11. public class Fibonaci{
		static int fib(int n)
		if(n<=1){
			return n;
		return fib(n-1)+fib(n-2);
		}
		public static void main(String[] args){
			int n=8;
			System.out.println(fib(n))
			}
		
}
12. By using isListOdd(). we can also use for loop to check whether it is odd.
14. Enumeration : enum is a keyword which is unchangeable type and containes group of constants.
It is used to restrict the data.
15. It allocates the static memory.
16. Variables , methods , inner class , constructor
